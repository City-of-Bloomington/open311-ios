About
------------------------------
GeoReporter is an Open311 constituent reporting tool. GeoReporter should work for any organizations with an Open311 GeoReport v2 compliant endpoint server.

GeoReporter connects to an organization's Open311 endpoint, reads its roster of constituent reports and makes them available to the constituent. The constituents can select the report they would like to submit, fill out the relevant information, take an optional photo and submit the report to be resolved. Constituents can also set up a profile to speed up contact information entry and review reports that have been submitted in the past.

Development Configuration
------------------------------
In order to compile, this app requires an AvailableServers.plist.  An example file is included: /iphone/open311/AvailableServers.example.plist.  You'll need to rename this file to AvailableServers.plist and edit it as needed.  This plist describes all the endpoints you want the app to work with.

Open311 endpoints require api_keys for communication.  You'll need to receive a separate api_key for each endpoint you want to work with.  The current list of known endpoints is maintained at:
